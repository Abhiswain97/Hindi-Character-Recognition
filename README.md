# Hindi-Character-Recognition

### The app is live on huggingface spaces! Try it -> [Gradio-HCR](https://huggingface.co/spaces/abhiswain/Gradio-Hindi-Character-Recognition)

## Running the app locally:

You can run the streamlit and gradio app locally. 

1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Now, just do `streamlit run app.py` or `gradio gradio_app.py`

### Streamlit demo

## Training the model (Optional)

1. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Hindi Character Recognition

    Getting the data:
    - Download the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suvooo/hindi-character-recognition)
    - Unzip it. You need to split the data into 4 different directories, since we are training for Hindi digits & letters separately.

    How to run ?
    - You can create your custom model in the `model.py` file or can go with the `HNet` already present. For custom models created, you need to import them to `train.py`, for them to to use. Remember we are training different models for Hindi Digit & Characters.
    - Now to train the model with default params do, `python train.py`. You can also specify epochs and lr. Most important, is the `model_type`
    - To train do, `python train.py --epochs <num-epochs> --lr <learning-rate> --model_type <type-of-model>`
